First, \\na free version of this book is being offered to the world in a \\ndigital/Kindle/eBook format with no strings attached. Second, \\nI’ve known Naval for more than a decade and have long wanted \\nsomeone to compile this book. Third, I’m increasing the like-\\nlihood of Naval’ s next child being named “Tim” (I’ll settle for \\n“Timbo,” if he prefers).\\nNaval is one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, and he’ s also \\none of the most courageous. Not in the “run into the fire with -\\nout thinking twice” sense, but in the “think twice and then tell \\neveryone they’re focusing on the wrong fire” sense. He is rarely \\npart of any consensus, and the uniqueness of his life, lifestyle, \\nfamily dynamics, and startup successes is a reflection of con -\\nscious choices he’ s made to do things differently.14 · THE ALMANACK OF NAVAL RAVIKANTHe can be as blunt as a foot to the face, but that’ s part of what I \\nlove and respect about him: you never have to guess what Naval \\nis thinking. I’ve never had to guess how he’ s feeling about me, \\nsomeone else, or a situation. This is a huge relief in a world of \\ndouble-talk and ambiguity.\\nWe’ve shared a lot of meals, shared a lot of deals, and hopped \\naround the world together. That’ s all to say that, while I con -\\nsider myself a good people-watcher, I consider myself an \\nexcellent Naval-watcher. He is one of the people I call most \\nfor advice, and I’ve watched him in many habitats through \\nmany seasons: easy times, hard times, recessions, booms—\\nyou name it.\\nSure, he’s the CEO and a co-founder of AngelList. Sure, he \\npreviously co-founded Vast.com and Epinions, which went \\npublic as part of Shopping.com. Sure, he’ s an angel investor \\nand has invested in many mega successes, including Twitter, \\nUber, Yammer, and OpenDNS, to name but a few.\\nThat’ s all great, of course, and it shows Naval is a world-class \\noperator instead of an armchair philosopher.\\nBut I don’t take his perspectives, maxims, and thoughts seri -\\nously because of the business stuff. There are lots of miserable \\n“successful” people out there. Be careful about modeling those, \\nas you will get all the bathwater with the baby.\\nI take Naval seriously because he:\\n → Questions nearly everything\\n → Can think from first principles\\n → Tests things wellFOREWORD ·  15 → Is good at not fooling himself\\n → Changes his mind regularly\\n → Laughs a lot\\n → Thinks holistically\\n → Thinks long-term\\n → And…doesn’t take himself too goddamn seriously.\\nThat last one is important.\\nThis book will give you a good taste of what that cocktail of \\nbullets looks like in Naval’ s head.\\nSo, pay attention…but don’t simply parrot his words. Follow \\nhis advice…but only if it holds up after scrutiny and stress-\\ntesting in your own life. Consider everything…but take nothing \\nas gospel. Naval would want you to challenge him, as long as \\nyou bring your A-game.\\nNaval has changed my life for the better, and if you approach \\nthe following pages like a friendly but highly competent spar-\\nring partner, he might just change yours.\\nKeep your hands up and your mind open.\\nPura Vida,\\nTim Ferriss\\nAustin, TexasERIC ’S NOTE  (ABOUT  THIS  BOOK ) · 17ERIC’S NOTE (ABOUT \\nTHIS BOOK)\\nThroughout his career, Naval has generously shared his \\nwisdom, and millions of people around the world follow his \\nadvice on building wealth and living happily.\\nNaval Ravikant is an icon in Silicon Valley and startup culture \\naround the world. He founded multiple successful companies \\n(Epinions during the 2000 dot-com crash, AngelList in 2010). \\nNaval is also an angel investor, betting early on companies like \\nUber, Twitter, Postmates, and hundreds more.\\nMore than a financial success, Naval has been sharing his own \\nphilosophy of life and happiness, attracting readers and listen -\\ners throughout the world. Naval is broadly followed because he \\nis a rare combination of successful and happy. After a lifetime \\nof study and application of philosophy, economics, and wealth \\ncreation, he has proven the impact of his principles.\\nToday, Naval continues to build and invest in companies almost \\ncasually, in his own artistic way, while maintaining a healthy, \\npeaceful, and balanced life. This book collects and organizes 18 · THE ALMANACK OF NAVAL RAVIKANTthe pieces of wisdom he has shared and shows you how to \\nachieve the same for yourself.\\nNaval’s life story is instructive. An introspective founder, \\nself-taught investor, capitalist, and engineer certainly has \\nsomething to teach us all.\\nAs a first-principles thinker with no fear of speaking his truth, \\nNaval’ s thoughts are often unique and thought-provoking. His \\ninstinct for seeing through life’ s veneer has changed how I see \\nthe world.\\nI’ve learned an enormous amount from Naval. Reading, listening, \\nand applying his principles of wealth and happiness has given \\nme calm confidence on my path and taught me to enjoy every \\nmoment of this journey. Closely studying his career has shown \\nme how great things are accomplished through small, persistent \\nsteps, and how large an impact one individual can have.\\nI refer to his work often and recommend it to friends. Those \\nconversations inspired me to create this book, so people can \\nlearn from his perspective whether they’re new to Naval’ s ideas \\nor have followed him the past ten years.\\nThis book collects the wisdom shared by Naval over the past \\ndecade in his own words through Twitter, blog posts, and pod -\\ncasts. With this book, you can get the benefits of a lifetime in \\na few hours.\\nI created this book as a public service. Tweets, podcasts, and \\ninterviews quickly get buried and lost. Knowledge this valu -\\nable deserves a more permanent, accessible format. That is \\nmy mission with this book.ERIC ’S NOTE  (ABOUT  THIS  BOOK ) · 19I hope this acts as an introduction to Naval’ s ideas. I’ve col -\\nlected his most powerful and useful ideas in his own words, \\nwoven them into a readable thread, and organized those into \\nsections for easy reference.\\nI often find myself reviewing sections of this book before \\nmaking an investment or opening to the Happiness chapter if \\nI’m feeling off. Creating this book has changed me. I feel more \\nclarity, confidence, and peace through all aspects of life. I hope \\nreading it will do the same for you.\\nThe Almanack is intended as a guide to be read and consulted \\nfor specific topics. If Naval doesn’t answer your emails, I hope \\nthis book gives you the next-best advice.\\nThis book is an introduction to Naval and dives deeply into his \\ntwo most-explored topics: wealth and happiness. If you want \\nto continue exploring Naval and his other ideas, I encourage \\nyou to check out the “Next on Naval” section at the end of this \\nbook.

We were very self-sufficient from a very early age. There \\nwas a lot of hardship, but everyone goes through hardship. It \\ndid help me in a number of ways.\\nWe were poor immigrants. My dad came to the US—he was a \\npharmacist in India. But his degree wasn’t accepted here, so \\nhe worked in a hardware store. Not a great upbringing, you \\nknow. My family split up.\\xa0[47]\\nMy mother uniquely provided, against the background of hard-\\nship, unconditional and unfailing love. If you have nothing \\nin your life, but you have at least one person that loves you \\nunconditionally, it’ll do wonders for your self-esteem.\\xa0[8]\\nWe were in a part of New York City that isn’t very safe. Basically, \\nthe library was my after-school center. After I came back from \\nschool, I would just go straight to the library and hang out \\nthere until they closed. Then, I would come home. That was \\nmy daily routine.\\xa0[8]\\nWe moved to the US when we were very young. I didn’t have \\nmany friends, so I wasn’t very confident. I spent a lot of time \\nreading. My only real friends were books. Books make for great \\nfriends, because the best thinkers of the last few thousand \\nyears tell you their nuggets of wisdom.\\xa0[8]\\nMy first job was with an illegal catering company in the back \\nof a van delivering Indian food when I was fifteen. Even when \\nI was younger, I had a paper route and I washed dishes in the \\ncafeteria.NOW , HERE  IS NAVAL  IN  HIS  OWN  WORDS … · 25I was a totally unknown kid in New York City from a nothing \\nfamily, an “immigrants trying to survive” situation. Then, I \\npassed the test to get into Stuyvesant High School. That saved \\nmy life, because once I had the Stuyvesant brand, I got into an \\nIvy League college, which led me into tech. Stuyvesant is one \\nof those intelligence lottery situations where you can break in \\nwith instant validation. You go from being blue collar to white \\ncollar in one move.\\xa0[73]\\nAt Dartmouth, I studied economics and computer science. \\nThere was a time when I thought I was going to be a PhD in \\neconomics.\\xa0[8]\\nToday, I’m an investor, personally, in about two hundred com -\\npanies. Advisor to a bunch. I’m on a bunch of boards. I’m also \\na small partner in a cryptocurrency fund because I’m really \\ninto the potential of cryptocurrencies. I’m always cooking up \\nsomething new. I always have a bunch of side projects.\\xa0[4]\\nAll that, of course, in addition to being the founder and chair-\\nman of AngelList.\\xa0[4]\\nI was born poor and miserable. I’m now pretty well-off, and \\nI’m very happy. I worked at those.\\nI’ve learned a few things, and some principles. I try to lay them \\nout in a timeless manner, where you can figure it out for your-\\nself. Because at the end of the day, I can’t quite teach anything. \\nI can only inspire you and maybe give you a few hooks so you \\ncan remember.\\xa0[77]26 · THE ALMANACK OF NAVAL RAVIKANTLive, on Twitter, it’s Naval (applause ensues…)\\nOn May 18th, 2007PART I\\nWEALTH\\nHow to get rich without getting lucky.BUILDING  WEALTH ·  29BUILDING WEALTH\\nMaking money is not a thing you do—it’s a skill you learn.30 · THE ALMANACK OF NAVAL RAVIKANTUNDERSTAND HOW WEALTH IS CREATED\\nI like to think that if I lost all my money and you dropped me \\non a random street in any English-speaking country, within \\nfive or ten years I’d be wealthy again because it’ s just a skillset \\nI’ve developed that anyone can develop.\\xa0[78]\\nIt’ s not really about hard work. You can work in a restaurant \\neighty hours a week, and you’re not going to get rich. Getting \\nrich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when \\nto do it. It is much more about understanding than purely hard \\nwork. Yes, hard work matters, and you can’t skimp on it. But \\nit has to be directed in the right way.\\nIf you don’t know yet what you should work on, the most \\nimportant thing is to figure it out. You should not grind at a \\nlot of hard work until you figure out what you should be work -\\ning on.\\nI came up with the principles in my tweetstorm (below) for \\nmyself when I was really young, around thirteen or fourteen. \\nI’ve been carrying them in my head for thirty years, and I’ve \\nbeen living them. Over time (sadly or fortunately), the thing I \\ngot really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out \\nthe point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and \\ncapture some of that created wealth.\\nThis is exactly what I did my famous tweetstorm about. Of \\ncourse, every one of these tweets can be extrapolated into an \\nhour’ s worth of conversation. The tweetstorm below is a good \\nstarting point. The tweetstorm tries to be information-dense, \\nvery concise, high-impact, and timeless. It has all the informa -\\ntion and principles, so if you absorb these and you work hard \\nover ten years, you’ll get what you want.\\xa0[77]BUILDING  WEALTH ·  31How to Get Rich (Without Getting Lucky):\\n↓\\nSeek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets \\nthat earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time \\nand wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.\\n↓\\nUnderstand ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly \\ndespise wealth, it will elude you.\\n↓\\nIgnore people playing status games. They gain status by \\nattacking people playing wealth creation games.\\n↓\\nYou’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must \\nown equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial \\nfreedom.\\n↓\\nYou will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not \\nyet know how to get. At scale.\\n↓32 · THE ALMANACK OF NAVAL RAVIKANTPick an industry where you can play long-term games with \\nlong-term people.\\n↓\\nThe internet has massively broadened the possible space of \\ncareers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet.\\n↓\\nPlay iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, \\nrelationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.\\n↓\\nPick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, \\nabove all, integrity.\\n↓\\nDon’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are \\nself-fulfilling.\\n↓\\nLearn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be \\nunstoppable.\\n↓BUILDING  WEALTH ·  33Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and \\nleverage.\\n↓\\nSpecific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. \\nIf society can train you, it can train someone else and replace \\nyou.\\n↓\\nSpecific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine \\ncuriosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.\\n↓\\nBuilding specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will \\nlook like work to others.\\n↓\\nWhen specific knowledge is taught, it’s through \\napprenticeships, not schools.\\n↓\\nSpecific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It \\ncannot be outsourced or automated.\\n↓34 · THE ALMANACK OF NAVAL RAVIKANTEmbrace accountability, and take business risks under your \\nown name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, \\nand leverage.\\n↓\\n“Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will \\nmove the earth.”\\n—Archimedes\\n↓\\nFortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from \\ncapital, people, and products with no marginal cost of \\nreplication (code and media).\\n↓\\nCapital means money. To raise money, apply your specific \\nknowledge with accountability and show resulting good \\njudgment.\\n↓\\nLabor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most \\nfought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress \\nyour parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.\\n↓BUILDING  WEALTH ·  35Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is \\nchasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone \\nis trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.\\n↓\\nCode and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the \\nleverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and \\nmedia that works for you while you sleep.\\n↓\\nAn army of robots is freely available—it’s just packed in data \\ncenters for heat and space efficiency. Use it.\\n↓\\nIf you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and \\npodcasts.\\n↓\\nLeverage is a force multiplier for your judgment.\\n↓\\nJudgment requires experience but can be built faster by \\nlearning foundational skills.\\n↓36 · THE ALMANACK OF NAVAL RAVIKANTThere is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines \\nand business classes.\\n↓\\nStudy microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, \\nethics, mathematics, and computers.\\n↓\\nReading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.\\n↓\\nYou should be too busy to “do coffee” while still keeping an \\nuncluttered calendar.\\n↓\\nSet and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If \\nfixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore \\nit. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, \\noutsource it.\\n↓\\nWork as hard as you can. Even though who you work with \\nand what you work on are more important than how hard \\nyou work.\\n↓BUILDING  WEALTH ·  37Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep \\nredefining what you do until this is true.\\n↓\\nThere are no get-rich-quick schemes. Those are just someone \\nelse getting rich off you.\\n↓\\nApply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you \\nwill get what you deserve.\\n↓\\nWhen you’re finally wealthy, you’ll realize it wasn’t what you \\nwere seeking in the first place. But that is for another day.\\xa0[11]\\nSummary: Productize Yourself\\nYour summary says “Productize yourself”—what does that \\nmean?\\n“Productize” and “yourself.” “Yourself” has uniqueness. \\n“Productize” has leverage. “Yourself” has accountability. “Pro-\\nductize” has specific knowledge. “Yourself ” also has specific \\nknowledge in there. So all of these pieces, you can combine \\nthem into these two words.38 · THE ALMANACK OF NAVAL RAVIKANTIf you’re looking toward the long-term goal of getting wealthy, \\nyou should ask yourself, “Is this authentic to me? Is it myself \\nthat I am projecting?” And then, “ Am I productizing it? Am I \\nscaling it? Am I scaling with labor or with capital or with code \\nor with media?” So it’s a very handy, simple mnemonic.\\xa0[78]\\nThis is hard. This is why I say it takes decades—I’m not saying \\nit takes decades to execute, but the better part of a decade may \\nbe figuring out what you can uniquely provide.\\xa0[10]\\nWhat’s the difference between wealth and money?\\nMoney is how we transfer wealth. Money is social credits. It \\nis the ability to have credits and debits of other people’ s time.\\nIf I do my job right, if I create value for society, society says, “Oh, \\nthank you. We owe you something in the future for the work \\nyou did in the past. Here’ s a little IOU. Let’ s call that money.”\\xa0[78]\\nWealth is the thing you want. Wealth is assets that earn while \\nyou sleep. Wealth is the factory, the robots, cranking out things. \\nWealth is the computer program that’ s running at night, serv -\\ning other customers. Wealth is even money in the bank that is \\nbeing reinvested into other assets, and into other businesses.\\nEven a house can be a form of wealth, because you can rent it \\nout, although that’ s probably a lower productivity use of land \\nthan some commercial enterprise.\\nSo, my definition of wealth is much more businesses and assets \\nthat can earn while you sleep.\\xa0[78]BUILDING  WEALTH ·  39Technology democratizes consumption but consolidates \\nproduction. The best person in the world at anything gets to \\ndo it for everyone.\\nSociety will pay you for creating things it wants. But society \\ndoesn’t yet know how to create those things, because if it did, \\nthey wouldn’t need you. They would already be stamped out.\\nAlmost everything in your house, in your workplace, and on the \\nstreet used to be technology at one point in time.

You don’t want to be wealthy in the fifty of them where \\nyou got lucky, so we want to factor luck out of it.\\nBut getting lucky would help, right?\\nJust recently, Babak Nivi, my co-founder, and I were talking \\non Twitter about how one gets lucky, and there are really four \\nkinds of luck we were talking about.\\nThe first kind of luck is blind luck where one just gets lucky \\nbecause something completely out of their control happened. \\nThis includes fortune, fate, etc.\\nThen, there’ s luck through persistence, hard work, hustle, and \\nmotion. This is when you’re running around creating opportu -\\nnities. You’re generating a lot of energy, you’re doing a lot to stir \\nthings up. It’ s almost like mixing a petri dish or mixing a bunch \\nof reagents and seeing what combines. You’re just generating \\nenough force, hustle, and energy for luck to find you.\\nA third way is you become very good at spotting luck. If you \\nare very skilled in a field, you will notice when a lucky break \\nhappens in your field, and other people who aren’t attuned to \\nit won’t notice. So, you become sensitive to luck.\\nThe last kind of luck is the weirdest, hardest kind, where you \\nbuild a unique character, a unique brand, a unique mindset, \\nwhich causes luck to find you.\\nFor example, let’s say you’re the best person in the world \\nat deep- sea diving. You’re known to take on deep- sea dives \\nnobody else will even dare to attempt. By sheer luck, somebody 84 · THE ALMANACK OF NAVAL RAVIKANTfinds a sunken treasure ship off the coast they can’t get to. \\nWell, their luck just became your luck, because they’re going \\nto come to you to get to the treasure, and you’re going to get \\npaid for it.\\nThis is an extreme example, but it shows how one person had \\nblind luck finding the treasure. Them coming to you to extract \\nit and give you half is not blind luck. You created your own luck. \\nYou put yourself in a position to capitalize on luck or to attract \\nluck when nobody else created the opportunity for themselves. \\nTo get rich without getting lucky, we want to be deterministic. \\nWe don’t want to leave it to chance.\\xa0[78]\\nWays to get lucky:\\n• Hope luck finds you.\\n• Hustle until you stumble into it.\\n• Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss.\\n• Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until \\nthis is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes \\nyour destiny.\\nIt starts becoming so deterministic, it stops being luck. The \\ndefinition starts fading from luck to destiny. To summarize \\nthe fourth type: build your character in a certain way, then \\nyour character becomes your destiny.\\nOne of the things I think is important to make money is having \\na reputation that makes people do deals through you.

And \\nI know there are people and companies popularizing this con -\\ncept because it serves them and their business model well, but \\nthe reality is if you’re building something interesting, you will \\nalways have more people who will want to know you.

Because it’s a big question, I’ll give you \\nthree answers.\\nAnswer 1: It’ s personal. You have to find your own meaning. \\nAny piece of wisdom anybody else gives you, whether it’s \\nBuddha or me, is going to sound like nonsense. Fundamentally, \\nyou have to find it for yourself, so the important part is not \\nthe answer, it’ s the question. You just have to sit there and dig \\nwith the question. It might take you years or decades. When \\nyou find an answer you’re happy with, it will be fundamental \\nto your life.\\nAnswer 2: There is no meaning to life. There is no purpose to \\nlife. Osho said, “It’s like writing on water or building houses \\nof sand.” The reality is you’ve been dead for the history of the \\nUniverse, 10 billion years or more. You will be dead for the \\nnext 70 billion years or so, until the heat death of the Universe.\\nAnything you do will fade. It will disappear, just like the human \\nrace will disappear and the planet will disappear. Even the \\ngroup who colonizes Mars will disappear. No one is going to \\nremember you past a certain number of generations, whether \\nyou’re an artist, a poet, a conqueror, a pauper, or anyone else. \\nThere’ s no meaning.\\nYou have to create your own meaning, which is what it boils \\ndown to.

What kind \\nof silly God judges you for eternity based on some small period \\nof time here? I think after this life, it’ s very much like before \\nyou were born. Remember that?

After death, \\nyou just don’t care either.\\nAnswer 3: The last answer I’ll give you is a little more complicated. \\nFrom what I’ve read in science (friends of mine have written \\nbooks on this), I’ve stitched together some theories. Maybe there \\nis a meaning to life, but it’s not a very satisfying purpose.\\nBasically, in physics, the arrow of time comes from entropy. 196 · THE ALMANACK OF NAVAL RAVIKANTThe second law of thermodynamics states entropy only goes \\nup, which means disorder in the Universe only goes up, which \\nmeans concentrated free energy only goes down. If you look \\nat living things (humans, plants, civilizations, what have you) \\nthese systems are locally reversing entropy. Humans locally \\nreverse entropy because we have action.\\nIn the process, we globally accelerate entropy until the heat \\ndeath of the Universe. You could come up with some fanciful \\ntheory, which I like, that we’re headed towards the heat death \\nof the Universe. In that death, there’ s no concentrated energy, \\nand everything is at the same energy level. Therefore, we’re all \\none thing. We’re essentially indistinguishable.\\nWhat we do as living systems accelerates getting to that state. \\nThe more complex system you create, whether it’s through \\ncomputers, civilization, art, mathematics, or creating a \\nfamily—you actually accelerate the heat death of the Universe. \\nYou’re pushing us towards this point where we end up as one \\nthing.\\xa0[4]\\nLIVE BY YOUR VALUES\\nWhat are your core values?\\nI’ve never fully enumerated them, but a few examples:\\nHonesty is a core, core, core value. By honesty, I mean I want to \\nbe able to just be me. I never want to be in an environment or \\naround people where I have to watch what I say.

Anyone around whom I can’t be fully honest, I don’t \\nwant to be around.\\nBefore you can lie to another, you must first lie to yourself.\\nAnother example of a foundational value: I don’t believe in \\nany short-term thinking or dealing. If I’m doing business with \\nsomebody and they think in a short-term manner with some-\\nbody else, then I don’t want to do business with them anymore. \\nAll benefits in life come from compound interest, whether in \\nmoney, relationships, love, health, activities, or habits. I only \\nwant to be around people I know I’m going to be around for \\nthe rest of my life. I only want to work on things I know have \\nlong-term payout.\\nAnother one is I only believe in peer relationships. I don’t \\nbelieve in hierarchical relationships. I don’t want to be above \\nanybody, and I don’t want to be below anybody. If I can’t treat \\nsomeone like a peer and if they can’t treat me like peer, I just \\ndon’t want to interact with them.\\nAnother: I don’t believe in anger anymore. Anger was good \\nwhen I was young and full of testosterone, but now I like the \\nBuddhist saying, “Anger is a hot coal you hold in your hand \\nwhile waiting to throw it at somebody.” I don’t want to be angry, \\nand I don’t want to be around angry people.
